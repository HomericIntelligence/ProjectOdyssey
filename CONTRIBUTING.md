## Development Setup

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.7 or higher
- Mojo compiler (v0.26.1 or later)
- Git
- GitHub CLI (`gh`) for PR workflows

### Environment Setup with Pixi

We use [Pixi](https://pixi.sh/) for environment management. This ensures everyone uses the same dependencies.

```bash
# Install Pixi (if not already installed)
# Visit https://pixi.sh/ for installation instructions

# Create and activate the development environment
pixi shell
```

### Verify Your Setup

```bash
# Check Mojo installation
mojo --version

# Check Python installation
python3 --version

# Verify GitHub CLI authentication
gh auth status

# Install pre-commit hooks
pre-commit install
```

## Development Workflow

### 1. Find or Create an Issue

Before starting work:

- Browse [existing issues](https://github.com/mvillmow/ml-odyssey/issues)
- Comment on an issue to claim it before starting work
- Create a new issue if one doesn't exist for your contribution
- Wait for maintainer approval on significant changes

### 2. Branch Naming Convention

Create a feature branch from `main`:

```bash
# Update your local main branch
git checkout main
git pull origin main

# Create a feature branch
git checkout -b <issue-number>-<short-description>

# Examples:
git checkout -b 2654-add-contributing-guidelines
git checkout -b 1928-consolidate-test-assertions
```

**Branch naming rules:**

- Start with the issue number
- Use lowercase letters
- Use hyphens to separate words
- Keep descriptions short but descriptive

### 3. Make Your Changes

- Follow the [Code Standards](#code-style-guidelines) below
- Write tests for new functionality (see [Testing Guidelines](#testing-guidelines))
- Keep commits focused and atomic
- Update documentation as needed

### 4. Commit Message Format

We follow [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/):

```text
<type>(<scope>): <subject>

<body>

<footer>
```

**Types:**

| Type       | Description                |
|------------|----------------------------|
| `feat`     | New feature                |
| `fix`      | Bug fix                    |
| `docs`     | Documentation only         |
| `style`    | Formatting, no code change |
| `refactor` | Code restructuring         |
| `test`     | Adding/updating tests      |
| `chore`    | Maintenance tasks          |

**Example:**

```bash
git commit -m "feat(core): add SIMD optimization to matmul

Implements #2588 - optimize matrix multiplication with cache tiling
and SIMD vectorization for 10x speedup on large matrices.

Closes #2588"
```

### 5. Push and Create Pull Request

```bash
# Push your branch
git push -u origin <branch-name>

# Create pull request linked to issue
gh pr create --title "[Type] Brief description" --body "Closes #<issue-number>"

# Enable auto-merge (PR will merge when CI passes)
gh pr merge --auto --rebase
```

**Important:** Always enable auto-merge so PRs merge automatically once CI passes and reviews
are complete.

### Never Push Directly to Main

The `main` branch is protected. All changes must go through pull requests:

- Direct pushes to `main` will be rejected
- Even single-line fixes require a PR
- This ensures code review and CI validation

See [CLAUDE.md](CLAUDE.md#-critical-rules---read-first) for complete branch protection rules.

## Running Tests

We follow Test-Driven Development (TDD) principles. Tests should be written before implementation whenever possible.

```bash
# Run all tests
just test

# Run only Mojo tests
just test-mojo

# Run specific test file
mojo test tests/shared/core/test_tensor.mojo

# Run tests for a specific group
just test-group tests/shared/core "test_*.mojo"

# Format code before testing
just format
```

## Code Style Guidelines

### Mojo Code Style

We use `mojo format` for consistent code formatting. Pre-commit hooks will automatically run this on staged files.

**Key principles for Mojo code:**

- Use `fn` over `def` for performance-critical code
- Use `out self` for constructors, `mut self` for mutating methods
- Use `struct` with `@fieldwise_init` for simple data types
- Leverage SIMD operations for performance-critical code
- Add comprehensive docstrings to all public APIs

**Current Mojo syntax (v0.26.1+):**

| Convention   | Use For            | Example                              |
|--------------|--------------------|--------------------------------------|
| `out self`   | Constructors       | `fn __init__(out self, value: Int)`  |
| `mut self`   | Mutating methods   | `fn modify(mut self)`                |
| `self`       | Read-only access   | `fn get(self) -> Int`                |
| `^` operator | Ownership transfer | `return self._data^`                 |

**Example:**

```mojo
@fieldwise_init
struct Point(Copyable, Movable):
    var x: Float32
    var y: Float32

    fn distance(self, other: Point) -> Float32:
        """Calculate Euclidean distance to another point."""
        var dx = self.x - other.x
        var dy = self.y - other.y
        return (dx * dx + dy * dy).sqrt()
```

For complete Mojo guidelines, see:

- [Mojo Guidelines](.claude/shared/mojo-guidelines.md) - Current syntax reference
- [Mojo Anti-Patterns](.claude/shared/mojo-anti-patterns.md) - Common mistakes to avoid

### Python Code Style

Python is used for automation scripts where Mojo has limitations (subprocess capture, regex processing).

**Requirements:**

- Python 3.7+ compatibility
- Type hints for all function parameters and return values
- Docstrings using Google style
- Format with `black` (included in pre-commit)

**Example:**

```python
def calculate_mean(values: list[float]) -> float:
    """Calculate the mean of a list of values.

    Args:
        values: List of numeric values

    Returns:
        Mean of the values

    Raises:
        ValueError: If values list is empty
    """
    if not values:
        raise ValueError("Cannot calculate mean of empty list")
    return sum(values) / len(values)
```

### Documentation Style

All documentation files follow markdown standards and must pass `markdownlint-cli2` linting.

**Key rules:**

- Code blocks must have a language specified (` ```python ` not ` ``` `)
- Code blocks must be surrounded by blank lines (before and after)
- Lists must be surrounded by blank lines
- Headings must be surrounded by blank lines
- Lines should not exceed 120 characters
- Use relative links when possible

See [CLAUDE.md](CLAUDE.md#markdown-standards) for complete markdown standards.

### Pre-commit Hooks

Pre-commit hooks automatically check code quality before commits. They run:

- `mojo format` - Auto-format Mojo code
- `markdownlint-cli2` - Lint markdown files
- `trailing-whitespace` - Remove trailing whitespace
- `end-of-file-fixer` - Ensure files end with newline
- `check-yaml` - Validate YAML syntax

```bash
# Install pre-commit hooks (one-time setup)
pre-commit install

# Run hooks on all files
just pre-commit-all

# Run hooks on staged files only
just precommit
```

**Hook Failure Policy:**

Pre-commit hooks exist to enforce code quality. **Never bypass them with `--no-verify`.**

When hooks fail:

1. **Read the error** - Hooks tell you exactly what's wrong
2. **Fix the issue** - Update your code to pass the check
3. **Verify locally** - Run `just pre-commit-all` before committing
4. **Commit properly** - Let hooks validate your changes

If a hook itself is broken (not your code):

- Use `SKIP=hook-id git commit` for that specific hook
- Document reason in commit message
- Create issue to fix the broken hook

## Pull Request Process

### Before You Start

1. Ensure an issue exists for your work (create one if needed)
2. Create a branch from `main` using naming convention: `<issue-number>-<description>`
3. Write tests first following TDD principles
4. Implement your changes
5. Run tests and pre-commit hooks locally: `just test && just pre-commit-all`

### Creating Your Pull Request

```bash
# Push your branch
git push -u origin <branch-name>

# Create pull request linked to issue
gh pr create --title "[Type] Description" --body "Closes #<issue-number>"

# Enable auto-merge
gh pr merge --auto --rebase
```

**PR Requirements:**

- **One PR per issue** - Each GitHub issue gets exactly ONE pull request
- PR must be linked to a GitHub issue
- PR title should be clear and descriptive
- PR description should summarize changes and reference the issue
- Enable auto-merge (`gh pr merge --auto --rebase`)

## Code Review

### What Reviewers Look For

Reviews focus on:

- **Correctness** - Does the code do what it claims?
- **Test coverage** - Are new features tested?
- **Performance** - Is critical code optimized?
- **Code clarity** - Is the code readable and maintainable?
- **Memory safety** - Are ownership and lifetimes correct?
- **API consistency** - Does it follow existing patterns?

### Responding to Review Comments

Address review comments promptly. Reply to EACH comment individually:

```bash
# Get review comment IDs
gh api repos/OWNER/REPO/pulls/PR_NUMBER/comments \
  --jq '.[] | {id: .id, path: .path, body: .body}'

# Reply to a specific comment
gh api repos/OWNER/REPO/pulls/PR_NUMBER/comments/COMMENT_ID/replies \
  --method POST \
  -f body="Fixed - [brief description]"
```

**Response format:**

- Keep responses short (1 line preferred)
- Start with "Fixed -" to indicate resolution
- Examples:
  - `Fixed - Updated conftest.py to use real repository root`
  - `Fixed - Removed deprecated section`

### After Review

1. Make requested changes
2. Verify CI passes: `just test && just pre-commit-all`
3. Push changes to update the PR
4. Request re-review if needed

### Merging

Once approved and CI passes:

1. Ensure auto-merge is enabled (`gh pr merge --auto --rebase`)
2. PR will merge automatically when all checks pass
3. Delete the feature branch after merging
4. Clean up local worktree if used

See [PR Workflow](.claude/shared/pr-workflow.md) for complete details.

## Reporting Issues

Use our [issue templates](.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/) for consistent reporting.

### Bug Reports

Include:

- Clear title describing the issue
- Steps to reproduce the problem
- Expected vs actual behavior
- Environment details (Mojo version, OS, Python version)
- Relevant code snippets or logs

### Feature Requests

Include:

- Clear title describing the feature
- Problem it solves or value it provides
- Proposed solution (if you have one)
- Alternatives considered

### Security Issues

**Do not open public issues for security vulnerabilities.**

See [SECURITY.md](SECURITY.md) for responsible disclosure process.

## Testing Guidelines

We follow Test-Driven Development principles.

### Two-Tier Testing Strategy

**Tier 1: Layerwise Unit Tests** (Run on every PR)

- Fast, deterministic tests using special FP-representable values
- Tests each layer independently (forward AND backward passes)
- Small tensor sizes to prevent timeouts
- Runtime target: < 12 minutes

**Tier 2: End-to-End Integration Tests** (Run weekly)

- Full model validation with real datasets
- Tests complete forward-backward pipeline
- Validates training convergence

### Writing Tests

1. Write tests before implementation (TDD)
2. Place tests in `tests/` directory mirroring module structure
3. Use descriptive names: `test_function_name_with_scenario`
4. Include docstrings explaining what is being tested

**Example:**

```mojo
fn test_relu_forward():
    """Test ReLU activation forward pass."""
    var input = Tensor[DType.float32]([1.0, -1.0, 0.5, -0.5])
    var output = relu(input)
    assert_equal(output[0], 1.0)
    assert_equal(output[1], 0.0)
    assert_equal(output[2], 0.5)
    assert_equal(output[3], 0.0)
```

### Test Coverage Requirements

- Test new features before implementation
- Test both happy paths and error cases
- Include edge cases
- Validate gradients for parametric layers

See [Testing Strategy](docs/dev/testing-strategy.md) for comprehensive documentation.
