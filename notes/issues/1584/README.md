# Issue #1584: Add Project Status, Vision, and Roadmap to README

## Overview

Enhance main README.md with project status section, vision statement, and development roadmap.

## Problem

Current README lacks:

- Clear project status (planning, development, production)
- Long-term vision and goals
- Development roadmap
- Contribution priorities

## Proposed Content

### Project Status Section

```markdown
## Project Status

**Phase**: Planning & Foundation (Pre-Alpha)

- ✅ Repository structure established
- ✅ Agent system implemented (38 agents)
- ✅ Skill system implemented (43 skills)
- 🚧 Shared library foundation (in progress)
- 📋 First paper implementation (planned)
```

### Vision Section

```markdown
## Vision

ML Odyssey aims to become the definitive Mojo-based platform for
reproducing and understanding classic ML research papers, with:

- 50+ reproduced papers spanning ML history
- Production-ready implementations optimized for performance
- Comprehensive testing and validation
- Educational resources and documentation
```

### Roadmap Section

```markdown
## Roadmap

### 2025 Q1: Foundation
- Complete shared library
- Implement first paper (LeNet-5)

### 2025 Q2: Growth
- Add 5 more papers
- Performance benchmarking
- Documentation expansion

### 2025 Q3-Q4: Maturity

```

## Benefits
