# 12-14-2025: Starting to ramp-down

So, I'm almost hitting the point where I want to move toward the next phase of development. The first phase basically has mostly been completed, but I need to finish the last 100 or so tasks. I think this can be done in 1-2 weeks. The next phase is to start with the experimentation with agentic workflows. Now that I have a sufficiently large codebase that was developed agentically. I want to be able to measure and judge how things work analytically. I'm planning on using the work that is already done as the 'experiment', but testing both an externally exposed repo(this one), and a private repo of C++20 code that I've been working on in parallel. This way that it is unlikely that a model could have been training on the entire set of code changes I'm testing. I'm hoping that once I am done, that I have a deeper understanding of what agentic changes I have made are really the ones making the difference, and what ones are superfluous.
