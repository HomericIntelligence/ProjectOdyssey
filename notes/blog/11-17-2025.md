## TL;DR

Completed two major tasks today: finished reviewing all code changes from last week's Claude Code session and heavily utilized remaining web-based Claude Code credits. Web Claude Code continues to frustrate with frequent disconnections and lack of GitHub CLI access, making it a non-starter for serious work. Updated Week 2 metrics show dramatic improvement: 1,135 issues closed (vs 398 yesterday), 278 PRs closed (vs 152), and 75% increase in code (135K lines vs 82K lines). Primary focus now shifts to training infrastructure—aiming for MNIST POC by end of week and full AlexNet E2E training on CPU by end of next week. Also working on a private "game-changing" project in parallel.

## Review and Credit Utilization

I had two tasks today: one was to finish "reviewing" all the code changes from last week's Claude Code session, and another was to heavily utilize the rest of my web-based Claude Code credits.

### The Disconnection Problem

It actually is very hard to utilize all the credits since I keep getting disconnected and the work just stops every few minutes. This gets annoying, so I'm constantly having to tell it to restart.

I'll have to figure out something better, but this along with no access to GitHub CLI, it kind of is a non-starter for production work.

### Container Exploration

I'm going to see if I can get the container to work, but it might be better to not focus on it at all for now. The work is kicking into full gear now with actual implementation.

---

## The Secret Project

I'm working on a new project that I think will be game-changing, so that is being developed in parallel of what I'm doing now. It is being developed privately, so might announce that one in the future if it works how I want it to.

This is separate from ML Odyssey but leverages many of the lessons learned about agentic workflows, model optimization, and structured task delegation.

## Updated Week 2 Data

Yesterday, I had data from Week 1 and Week 2, but Week 2 was incomplete on the source code side. I've went ahead and recomputed it based on the entirety of the work completed through today.

I'll do a more detailed analysis tomorrow, but wanted to add this as a point of clarification.

### Yesterday's Week 2 Data (11-16)

```text
+-----------------+-------+
| Metric          | Count |
+-----------------+-------+
| Issues Created  |   275 |
| Issues Closed   |   398 |
| PRs Created     |   264 |
| PRs Closed      |   152 |
| Lines Added     | 82782 |
| Lines Removed   | 12681 |
| Review Comments |    58 |
+-----------------+-------+
```

### Today's Week 2 Data (11-17, Complete)

```text
+-----------------+--------+
| Metric          |  Count |
+-----------------+--------+
| Issues Created  |    284 |
| Issues Closed   |   1135 |
| PRs Created     |    273 |
| PRs Closed      |    278 |
| Lines Added     | 135274 |
| Lines Removed   |  12949 |
| Review Comments |     58 |
+-----------------+--------+
```

So not much change in issues created, PRs created, or review comments, but a nearly **75% increase in code added** (82K → 135K lines) along with a huge number of GitHub issues and PRs closed.

A lot of this was planning work, which I moved from GitHub issues to source so that it is easier for the agents to understand why something was done. This shift from "planning in issues" to "planning in source" is an important architectural decision.

---

## Training Mode

The current work today was all on getting the core operations enabled so that I can start trying to train.

### Short-Term Goals

I'm hoping that by **end of this week**, I have the first training job running (MNIST) as a POC.

By **end of next week**, I can have AlexNet training E2E on a CPU and reproducing the results of the AlexNet Paper.

### Why This Matters

After I get that done, then I think my "experiment" will have proven itself sufficiently enough to post online the results.

The experiment isn't just "can agents write code"—it's "can an agentic orchestration system take a research paper and produce a working, reproducible implementation without direct human coding."

If MNIST and AlexNet both work E2E, that's validation of the entire approach:

- Hierarchical agent coordination
- Model-tier optimization
- Skills-based task delegation
- Risk-based process tiering
- Week-over-week efficiency improvements

## Three Discoveries

### Discovery 1: Web Disconnections Make Sustained Work Impractical

The frequent disconnections in web Claude Code (every few minutes) break workflow continuity and make it impossible to complete complex, multi-step tasks.

Combined with no GitHub CLI access, this relegates web Claude Code to:

- Simple, isolated tasks
- Documentation work
- Exploratory prototyping

For production workflows requiring repository automation, CI/CD integration, or multi-hour sustained work, it's not viable.

### Discovery 2: Planning Migration from Issues to Source Improves Agent Context

Moving planning documentation from GitHub issues into source code (as comments, docstrings, and architectural documentation) made a significant difference in agent effectiveness.

Agents can now:

- Read planning context directly alongside code
- Understand "why" decisions were made without external lookups
- Maintain consistency between plan and implementation

This 75% code increase (82K → 135K lines) reflects this migration, not just new features.

### Discovery 3: Clear Phase Transitions Are Emerging

The project is showing distinct phases:

- **Week 1 (Planning)**: 1,553 issues created, establishing structure
- **Week 2 (Infrastructure)**: 1,135 issues closed, building foundation
- **Week 3 (Implementation)**: Shift to actual training code and ML algorithms

This natural progression validates the phased approach. You can't rush to implementation without proper planning and infrastructure.

## What's Next

Immediate priorities:

1. **Build MNIST training infrastructure** - Core training loop, data loading, loss computation, gradient descent
2. **Implement basic tensor operations** - Forward/backward passes, parameter updates, SIMD optimizations
3. **Create training monitoring** - Loss tracking, metrics logging, checkpoint saving
4. **Validate on MNIST** - End-to-end training run that reproduces expected accuracy
5. **Prepare AlexNet architecture** - Network definition, layer implementations, data pipeline for ImageNet

---

## Reflections

This day taught me about transition points:

1. **Review closure enables forward progress** - Finishing last week's reviews cleared the decks for new work. Bulk handling was the right call.
2. **Planning in source > planning in issues** - Agents work better when context is co-located with code, not scattered across GitHub.
3. **Web tools have real limitations** - Disconnections and CLI restrictions aren't minor annoyances—they're fundamental blockers for serious work.
4. **Clear milestones drive focus** - "MNIST by end of week, AlexNet by end of next week" creates urgency and clarity.

The infrastructure phase is complete. The planning is in place. The agents are optimized. Now comes the actual implementation—building training infrastructure and validating on real ML tasks.

This is where the experiment either validates or fails. Let's build.

**Status:** Infrastructure complete, training mode active, MNIST implementation starting

**Next:** Build MNIST training infrastructure, implement tensor operations, validate E2E training loop

**Stats:**

- Week 2 final: 1,135 issues closed, 278 PRs closed, 135K lines added
- 75% code increase from yesterday (planning migration to source)
- Review backlog cleared completely
- Web Claude Code credits mostly consumed (but tool remains impractical)
- 2 major targets: MNIST (this week), AlexNet (next week)
- 1 secret project in parallel development
- 1 developer ready to actually write ML code instead of infrastructure
