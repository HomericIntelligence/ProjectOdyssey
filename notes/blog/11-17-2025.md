# 11-17-2025: Time to build training


I had to tasks today, one was to finish "reviewing" all the code changes from last weeks claude code session, and another was to heavily utilize the rest of my web based claude code credits. It actually is very hard to utilize all the credits since I keep getting disconnected and the work just stops every few minutes. This gets annoying, so I'm constantly having to tell it to restart. I'll have to figure out something better, but this along with no access to github CLI, it kind of is a non-starter. I'm going to see if I can get the container to work, but it might be better to not focus on it at all for now. The work is kicking into full gear now.

I'm working on a new project that I think will be game-changing, so that is being done in parallel of what I'm doing now. It is being developed privately, so might announce that one in the future if it works how I want it to.


## Updated data

Yesterday, I had data from week 1 and week 2, but week 2 was incomplete on the source code side. I've went ahead and recomputed it based on the entirety of the work. I'll do a more detailed analysis tomorrow, but wanted to add this as a point of clarification.

### Yesterdays Week 2 data

So not much change, but a nearly 75% increase in code added along with a huge number of github issues and PR's closed. A lot of this was planning work, which I moved from github issues to source so that it is easier for the agents to understand why something was done.

## Training mode

The current work today was all on getting the core operations enabled so that I can start trying to train. I'm hoping that by end of this week, I have the first training job running(MNIST) as a POC and that by end of next week I can have AlexNet training E2E on a CPU and reproducing the results of the AlexNet Paper. After I get that done, then I think my 'experiment' will have proven itself sufficiently enough to post online the results.
