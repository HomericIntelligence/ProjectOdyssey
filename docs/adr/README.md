# Architecture Decision Records (ADRs)

This directory contains Architecture Decision Records (ADRs) that document significant
architectural decisions made in the ML Odyssey project.

## What is an ADR?

An Architecture Decision Record captures a single architecture decision, including:

- **Context**: The situation and factors that led to the decision
- **Decision**: The specific choice that was made
- **Consequences**: The expected outcomes, both positive and negative
- **Alternatives Considered**: Other options that were evaluated

## ADR Status Lifecycle

ADRs move through the following statuses:

1. **Proposed**: Initial draft under discussion
2. **Accepted**: Decision approved and implemented
3. **Deprecated**: No longer applies (superseded or context changed)
4. **Superseded**: Replaced by a newer ADR (includes reference to replacement)

## When to Create an ADR

Create an ADR when making decisions that:

- Affect system architecture or structure
- Have long-term impact on the codebase
- Involve significant trade-offs
- May not be obvious to future contributors
- Represent a change from standard practices

## ADR Template

See [template.md](template.md) for the standard ADR format used in this project.
